- 👋  Hi, I’m @ThanGrove
- 👀  I’m interested in Digital Humanities—academic computing, digital scholarship and tools for helping scholars create such—specifically 
within the field of Tibetan Buddhism.
- 🌱  I’m currently learning Django, React, Git Webhooks, Test Driven Development.
- 💞️  I’m looking to collaborate on projects for [Tibetan and Himalayan Digital Library](https://www.thlib.org) 
and the [Contemplative Sciences Center](https://csc.virginia.edu)
